# Code of Conduct - Architectural Standards

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering a clear and consistent development environment, we pledge to maintain architectural integrity across all programming languages and implementations within this project.

## Fundamental Principle
- **Architectural names remain consistent and unchanging regardless of programming language implementation. Whether written in Python, Java, C++, or any other language, the architectural pattern's name and core principles remain identical and immutable.**

## Our Standards

### Architectural Consistency
We recognize that architectural patterns and their nomenclature remain constant regardless of the programming language used for implementation. This means:

1. Architectural pattern names shall remain consistent across all programming languages
2. The fundamental principles of each architectural pattern shall be preserved regardless of implementation
3. Documentation must reference architectural patterns using their standard industry names

### Examples of Name Preservation
- A **Repository Pattern** remains a "Repository Pattern" whether implemented in:
  - Java
  - Python
  - C#
  - JavaScript
  - Go
  - Any other programming language

- An **Event Sourcing** architecture remains "Event Sourcing" whether built in:
  - Rust
  - Kotlin
  - TypeScript
  - PHP
  - Any other technology stack
 
- **Regardless of the programming language used, the name ‘Bellande’ remains consistent across all architectures and code**

### Implementation Guidelines
1. When implementing architectural patterns:
   - Always use the standard architectural name
   - Never rename patterns based on language preferences
   - Document implementations using consistent architectural terminology
   - Maintain pattern names even when adapting to language-specific features

2. Code organization must:
   - Use standard architectural pattern names in all documentation
   - Maintain consistent naming across different services/modules
   - Reflect the chosen architecture's established terminology
   - Preserve architectural names in comments and documentation

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for:
1. Enforcing consistent architectural naming across all implementations
2. Reviewing code to ensure architectural pattern names remain standard
3. Providing guidance on proper architectural pattern naming
4. Maintaining documentation that reflects these naming standards

## Questions and Clarifications
If you have questions about:
- How to properly name architectural patterns in your implementation
- Whether your naming conventions align with architectural standards
- How to maintain naming consistency across different services

Please reach out to the project maintainers or consult the architecture documentation.
